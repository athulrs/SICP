(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
This is procedure follows recursive behaviour.

In (inc(+ dec a) b)),
Until value of a is decreased to 0, the inc( ) recalls the procedure and is recurisvely executed.



(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

This follows iterative procedure.
The value of a and b changes for all procedures
 (+ (dec a) (inc b)) is redefined for every step.
untill value of a is 0
The value of b increses.
